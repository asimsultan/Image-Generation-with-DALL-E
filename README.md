# Image Generation with DALL-E

Welcome to the Image Generation with DALL-E project! This project focuses on generating images from text descriptions using the DALL-E model.

## Introduction

Image generation involves creating images based on the context provided in text descriptions. In this project, we leverage the power of DALL-E to generate images using a dataset of text-image pairs.

## Dataset

For this project, we will use a custom dataset of text-image pairs. You can create your own dataset and place it in the `data/text_image_pairs.csv` file.

## Project Overview

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyTorch
- OpenAI DALL-E
- Pandas

### Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dalle_image_generation.git
cd dalle_image_generation
```

# Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Ensure your data includes text-image pairs. Place these files in the data/ directory.
# The data should be in a CSV file with two columns: input_text and target_image_url.

# To train the DALL-E model for image generation, run the following command:
python scripts/train.py --data_path data/text_image_pairs.csv --api_key YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY

# To evaluate the performance of the model, run:
python scripts/evaluate.py --model_path models/api_key.txt --data_path data/text_image_pairs.csv --api_key YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
